# Brief Program Sumaries # 

[Ant](https://github.com/SopheapSok/Coding-Portfolio/blob/master/Java%20Programs/ant.java): Program implement Prim's algorithm to determine the minimum total cost to dig a tunnel network that connects all ant hills.

[Calc](https://github.com/SopheapSok/Coding-Portfolio/blob/master/Java%20Programs/calc.java): Program uses BFS to determine the fewest number of button pressed needed to obtain the target value on the calculator display.

[Camera](https://github.com/SopheapSok/Coding-Portfolio/blob/master/Java%20Programs/camera.java): Program determines the minimum number of pictures needed to capture all the objects present by using a greedy algorithm.

[Countseq](https://github.com/SopheapSok/Coding-Portfolio/blob/master/Java%20Programs/countseq.java): Program uses dynamic programing to determine the number of occurrences of a given subsequence in a given sequence of letters.

[Pacman](https://github.com/SopheapSok/Coding-Portfolio/blob/master/Java%20Programs/pacman.java): Program uses dynamic programming to determine the maximum possible score Pac Man can achieve, the number of different paths that achieve that score and the first alphabetic path that yields the maximum possible score. 

[Sudoku](https://github.com/SopheapSok/Coding-Portfolio/blob/master/Java%20Programs/sudoku.java): Program implement backtracking to solve Sudoku puzzles.
