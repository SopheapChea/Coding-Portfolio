# Brief Program Summaries #

[ListyString](https://github.com/SopheapSok/Coding-Portfolio/blob/master/C%20Programs/ListyString.c): Program implement linked lists to represent strings.

[SmartArray](https://github.com/SopheapSok/Coding-Portfolio/blob/master/C%20Programs/SmartArray.c):  Program is a smart array which grows to accommodate new elements whenever it gets too full and trim array to size to prevent wasted space.

[SneakyRooks](https://github.com/SopheapSok/Coding-Portfolio/blob/master/C%20Programs/SneakyRooks.c): Program uses base conversions and the basic idea of hash tables to track location of rooks and determine if rooks are safe or can attack one another. 

[TriePrediction](https://github.com/SopheapSok/Coding-Portfolio/blob/master/C%20Programs/TriePrediction.c): Program uses the advanced tree data structure, trie, to store strings, and provide efficient insertion and lookup. Program also implement text prediction with the inclusion of subtries in the trie data structure. 

[Varg](https://github.com/SopheapSok/Coding-Portfolio/blob/master/C%20Programs/Varg.c): Program make use of variadic functions, in two different ways, to determent the first most frequent character in a list of arguments.

[Canny](https://github.com/SopheapSok/Coding-Portfolio/blob/master/C%20Programs/canny.c): Program implement Canny's edge detection. 

[Sobel](https://github.com/SopheapSok/Coding-Portfolio/blob/master/C%20Programs/sobel.c): Program implements thresholding on the gradient magnitude. Program outputs pic showing magnitude of the gradient, pic with low threshold, and pic with high threshold.
